## [Configuration Files in Python](https://martin-thoma.com/configuration-files-in-python/) by [Martin Thoma](https://martin-thoma.com/)

This document beautifully describes different configuration file
formats typically used with Python programs.

It gives a good overview of JSON, YAML, INI, XML, though it strangely
missed TOML.  Maybe TOML wasn't popular by the time the article was
written (2014-07-27.)


## [Using Environment Variables in Python for App Configuration and Secrets](https://www.doppler.com/blog/environment-variables-in-python)

I don't like this article.  I disagree so strongly with what it has to
say about how great environment variables are, for configuration.

BUT, it did a GREAT JOB illustrating working with environment
variables in Python.
